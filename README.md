# Frontal Face Detection

This project demonstrates the use of OpenCV's Haar Cascade to detect frontal faces in an image. It includes steps for setting up the environment, loading an image, and performing face detection.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) to detect faces in an image.
- **Visualization**: Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes in the output image.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Always show details


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FrontalFaceDetection.git
cd FrontalFaceDetection
Update the image path in the script or notebook:

python
Always show details

Copy code
image_path = "C:/path_to_your_image.jpg"
Run the notebook:

bash
Always show details

jupyter notebook Frontal Face Detection.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load the image
Perform face detection
Visualize the results
Results
The program detects frontal faces in the image and displays them with bounding boxes. You can replace the image file with your own to test additional cases.
